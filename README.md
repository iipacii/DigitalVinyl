# Digital Vinyl: Final Report Summary

## Project Overview

Digital Vinyl is a digital library project that explores innovative ways to preserve and share vinyl audio collections. The core concept is storing audio data within photos of album covers, merging visual and auditory experiences for easier archiving and sharing.

## Motivation

Vinyl records are cherished for their sound and cultural value, but physical media can degrade over time. Digitizing vinyl collections and embedding audio in album cover images offers a modern solution for preservation and accessibility.

## Valence and Arousal Analysis

The project includes analysis of vinyl audio for emotional features, specifically valence (positivity) and arousal (energy). These psychological metrics help characterize the emotional content of music tracks. Machine learning and data science techniques are used to extract and visualize these features, providing deeper insights into the music stored in the digital library.

## Project Flow

1. Digitize vinyl audio samples.
2. Encode audio data into album cover images (photos).
3. Store and organize these images in a digital library.
4. Enable retrieval and playback of audio from images.
5. Provide tools for users to browse, search, and experience vinyl collections digitally.

## Technologies Used

- Python for data processing, machine learning, and encoding
- Audio analysis libraries (e.g., librosa, scipy)
- Image manipulation libraries (e.g., PIL/Pillow)
- Machine learning frameworks (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Visualization tools (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn)
